Over the course of three days, we crafted an immersive and forward-thinking career simulation set within the XR (extended reality) metaverse, incorporating augmented reality (AR), mixed reality (MR), and virtual reality (VR) technologies.

This project consists of a fully working live XR metaverse demo, a structured research paper, and a full presentation slide deck.

This groundbreaking project aims to revolutionize career exploration by empowering students with an invaluable platform to navigate diverse career paths with ease and confidence. 

By leveraging cutting-edge XR technologies, we offer an immersive experience that goes beyond traditional methods, allowing students to engage with realistic scenarios and environments relevant to various professions.

Through interactive simulations, personalized guidance, and real-time feedback, participants gain crucial insights essential for making informed decisions regarding college majors and mapping out their future career trajectories.

Our innovative approach not only fosters exploration and curiosity but also equips students with the knowledge and confidence needed to pursue fulfilling and successful career paths.
